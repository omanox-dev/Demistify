# Demistify Backend Features

This document highlights all implemented and production-ready features in the Demistify backend as of September 2025.

## Authentication & Security
- JWT-based authentication (register, login, user info)
- Passwords securely hashed with bcrypt
- All secrets (API keys, SECRET_KEY) loaded from environment variables
- Input validation for registration (valid email format)
- CORS enabled for frontend access

## User Management
- Persistent user storage using SQLite (SQLModel)
- Unique email enforcement

## Document Analysis
- Clause segmentation endpoint (`/segment_clauses`) using rule-based logic
- File upload endpoint (`/upload`)
- Document simplification and summary endpoint (`/simplify`) powered by Google GenAI (Gemini)
- Input validation and sanitization for document text
- Rate limiting: `/simplify` endpoint limited to 5 requests/minute per user

## Error Handling & Logging
- Centralized logging for registration, login, and AI calls
- Detailed error messages for invalid input, duplicate registration, and failed AI calls

## Extensibility
- Ready for database expansion (user reports, history, etc.)
- Modular code structure for easy addition of new endpoints

## Next Steps
- Automated tests for endpoints
- Advanced NLP for clause segmentation
- Role-based explanations, risk scoring, multi-language support
- Security enhancements (HTTPS, secure headers)
